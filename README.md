<p>Bookmarklets are short pieces of Javascript that can do anything you program them to do. They're easy to code, Bookmark, and use. Some can make your webpage 3d, others can let you edit Google. Overall, they just make your computer more fun, and give you something to do. I hope they work and are entertaining,
